nestedTouch is another touch Plugin for jQuery that enables dragging objects on iOS devices (iPhone/iPad/iPod)

what can nestedTouch do for you?

- scroll indicators: these tiny little rounded boxes, which indicate your scroll position (vertical only for now)
- elastic dragging: move something over the edge and it will snap back
- kinetic dragging: give an object an push and it will move a little bit further
- scrolling: scroll an object with tailing & elastic borders (far away from being perfect)
- nested touchable objects: place an horizontal moveable object inside an vertical moveable object or vice versa.
- exclusive nested dragging: place an horizontal moveable object inside an vertical moveable object or vice versa. Will work only in one direction every time. Allows funcky scroll & show options panels a seen in Twitter for iPhone/iPad, Reeder and many other iOS Apps.

Coming up next:
- scroll indicator will get an relaitve length, not everytime 40 pixels
- horizontal scrolling
- less flickering (hopefully)
- events: pleanty of events to control every aspect of of your dragging and snapping
- clickable links inside the dragger. neccasary for every good scroller
